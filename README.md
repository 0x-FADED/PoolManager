# PoolManager
PoolManager.asi will attempt to identify the cause of a crash in RDR 2 if the crash is related to a memory pool within gameconfig.xml

# Currently crashes the game for some reason
possible rdr2 support but the game crashes at startup atm need to fiugre out what's problem and fix it x)

feel free to do a PR if you have any idea how to fix this.
